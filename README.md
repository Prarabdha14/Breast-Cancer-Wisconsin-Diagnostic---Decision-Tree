The classification task is to predict whether a breast mass is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on the extracted features. This task is crucial in medical diagnosis, as early detection of malignant tumors can significantly improve patient outcomes.
A decision tree is a reasonable model to try for this data because:
Decision trees are interpretable: They provide clear insights into the decision-making process, which is essential in medical applications where understanding the reasoning behind predictions is critical. Decision trees can handle both numerical and categorical data: The dataset contains numerical features, making decision trees a suitable choice. Decision trees are robust to irrelevant features: They can automatically select the most relevant features for making decisions, which is beneficial in datasets with many features like this one.
